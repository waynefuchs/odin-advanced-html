# The Rainbow EXPLANATION:

In "The Odin Project" > "Full Stack JavaScript" > "Advanced HTML and CSS" > "Tran sitions", the last paragraph of the lesson reads:

> "What’s important is that you have a solid understanding of these concepts and can apply them when necessary because hey, if you need to turn a button into a rainbow when it’s hovered over, you better be able to transition that rainbow!"

On the face of things, this seems like a very innocuous statement.
